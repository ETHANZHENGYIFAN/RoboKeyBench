Annotation Rules Summary:
Axes Identification: Red = x-axis, Green = y-axis, Blue  = z-axis.
Point Mapping: Label points numerically (e.g., point[1] refers to marked point 1 in the image).
Direction Representation:
For standard axes, use axis[±x/y/z] (e.g., axis[+z] = positive Z-axis).
For object-specific directions, use point[X][Y] to denote the direction from point X to point Y (e.g., point[1][2] = direction from point 1 to point 2).
